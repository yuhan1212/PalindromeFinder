# PalindromeFinder

User can set up their own palindrome rule by giving the off-by number,<br/>
and this program will read in a txt file and find out all words that fit the rule.<br/>
<br/>
For example, the word “flake” is an off-by-one palindrome.<br/>
If we forgive differences between characters that are 1 away in the alphabet,<br/>
it reads the same when read forward and backward<br/>
(‘f’ and ‘e’, and ‘k’ and ‘l’ are one away from each other).

### Features

* Build up data structure for deque and linked list.
* Read in txt files and check all content to find valid palindrome words (according to given rule).
* Implemented data structure concepts, recursion, conditionals, unit testing, interfaces and inheritance.
